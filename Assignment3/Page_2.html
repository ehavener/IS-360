        <h1>Why Don’tDrive?</h1>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <img alt="remember alt" class="rounded d-block float-right" src="./images/D.png"></img>
        <p>Don’tDrive is making difference in the community through significantly reducing
          drinking and driving. The main reason why drunk driving occurs is because
          of the inconvenience people experience when needing to get their car home
          after a few drinks.
        </p>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
          Don’tDrive solves this problem through being the only transportation network in Reno,
          Nevada that drives customers home in their own cars. Dont’Drive provides
          designated drivers to those who wish to enjoy their night out without the
          stress of getting their car home later. Customers are driven home in the
          comfort of their own car by a insured, licensed, and responsible DD. Don’tDrive
          provides an affordable and convenient alternative to driving home intoxicated
          or dealing with Uber, Lyft, or Taxis. Dont’Drive is helping reduce the
          number of drunk drivers on our roads while eliminating the chance of car
          vandalism.
