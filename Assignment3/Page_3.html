        <h2>Features</h2>
        <img alt="remember alt" class="rounded d-block float-right" src="./images/dd_over_tahoe.jpg"></img>
        <p>Request a ride on dontdrive.life or call 775-000-0000 to get picked up. The
          nearest team of designated drivers receives the ride request and proceeds
          to pick the customer up. Once the DD has greeted the customer and identified
          necessary information on vehicle registration and insurance, the DD will
          safely drive the customer home in their own car. The other driver follows
          in another car to transport the DD once the ride has been completed.
        </p>
        <h2>Payment Options</h2>
        <p>
          When the customer arrives at their destination they can pay via Tile (Credit/Debit)
          or cash.

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Don’t Drive’s mission, to reduce the prevalence of drunk driving, would not
          be made possible without our passionate drivers. Don’tDrive is all about
          bringing the community together to generate a solution for drinking and
          driving. Each driver is a member of the local community, and has made the
          Don’t Drive pledge. The Don’t Drive pledge is a company wide pledge to
          never endanger someone on the roads. “I pledge to never drink and drive.
          I pledge I will not let someone drink and drive”. Don’t Drive believes
          it isn’t enough for one person to pledge to never drink and drive. For
          this tragic issue to be solved, our community must make the pledge to net
          let someone drink and drive ever. Don’t Drive believes deeply in the power
          of a connected community. Every person who takes this pledge and shares
          their passion for this issue on their social media will get a free ride.
          The free ride will represent the life that person may have saved by sharing
          their post. The Don’t Drive Pledge is shared with all friends, family,
          and community members. Through word of mouth, people in the community will
          stay connected with a trusted sober driver at all times. Each one our drivers
          report directly to a local Team Leader that can manage all customer complaints.
          Everyone is encouraged to be involved, and should contact their local Team
          Leaders for information on becoming a DD. Through Don’t Drive’s transportation
          network and a strong passionate community the issue of Drunk Driving will
          finally solved.
