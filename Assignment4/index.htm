          XV is an underground rapper from Wichita, KS who had some hype back in the early
          2010s. He eventually signed to Warner Bros after his single 'Awesome' made
          the charts in 2012. It seemed like he was on the path to blow up, but for
          some reason he just never did. He released over 10 mixtapes, but never
          was able to drop his debut album, "The Kid With The Green Backpack", even
          after 10 years of hype and puchbacks. His unique sound was in part thanks
          to his friend and producer 'Seven.' They worked together constantly until
          one day they suddenly never made track together again. Shortly after that,
          around 2014, XV just disappeared off the map. Nobody had any idea why.
          That was until last week, just as his last fans had all but forgotten about
          him, he announced his album was coming. Soon.
